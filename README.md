# fullStack-app-capstone

The purpose of this project is to showcase the knowledge acquiered in module three
by developing a Full Stack Web Application that uses the MVC architecture. 
It's a food oredering mamangement web app where users can save, view, update and delete orders.

The targeted audience is restaurant managers, as this app could help keep track of order inventories.

*Front End
React JavaScript web application that communicates with the Back End by performing 
CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete). 
This application serves as the View component in the MVC model.

Back End
The Back End consists of two parts:

Java Spring based application that servers as the Controller component of the 
MVC model by accepting HTTP requests from the View component and converting them to commands for the Model, 
then sending data back to the View for it to display.

MySQL database that servers as the Model component of the MVC architecture by providing a dynamic data structure, 
independent of the user interface.
